                  a small village located in District Dera Ghazi Khan, 
                  Punjab, Pakistan on May 01, 2005. As the first boy in
                  my family, my arrival brought immense joy to my parents,
                  prompting my father to distribute sweets throughout the
                  village. This blog post will delve into the early
                  years of my life, highlighting the typical experiences
                  of a Saraiki child growing up in a rural setting. Join
                  me as I reminisce about the carefree days filled with
                  village games, cricket, and cherished memories before
                  my college years.Some of the memories that i never

                <div style="padding-left: 3rem;"><p>Like many other Punjabi or Saraiki children in similar villages, my childhood was filled with the simple pleasures of life. I immersed myself in traditional village games, such as Gulli Danda, Kanchy, Ludo, Kite Flying, Kabbadi, Hide and Seek, Pitho Garam, and Chuppan Chupai. Among these, my passion for cricket burned the brightest. Playing cricket became a daily routine, and my love for the sport was unmatched. However, my devotion to cricket sometimes drew admonishment from my Uncle and other relatives, as I dedicated more time to playing than focusing on my studies.</p></div>

                <div style="padding-left: 3rem;"><p>My early years of education followed the familiar pattern of most children in the village. I attended a private school up until the fifth grade in the small village of Dgkhan <span class="aq">Ladan</span> and later joined a Prime School located in the City for my further studies until matriculation. Academic pursuits took a backseat to my cricket passion during this time.I can never forget that exciting day when some of us friends decided to skip classes and play cricket.After some time, our principal reached where we were playing cricket and started beating in the ground. These moments created lasting memories that I still cherish to this day.</p></div>

                <div style="padding-left: 3rem;"><p>Nights in my village were filled with entertainment for the entire family. We would gather around the television to watch movies, drama serials on PTV, and spend quality time together. On occasion, I would venture out with my village friends to play Lukkan Chuppai. This game of hide-and-seek took on a unique twist, as we hid not only in houses but also in the vast fields, adding an extra element of thrill and excitement to our nighttime adventures. These carefree evenings fostered a sense of belonging and happiness within our close-knit community.</p></div>

A day spent in Rashid Minhas is worth remembering, especially staying awake at night reading, going home after twelve days and the mess there was very admirable.

Growing up in a small village in South Punjab, Pakistan, surrounded by the bordering beauty of nature, I embraced the spirit of community, playfulness, and the pursuit of my passions. While my academic dedication may have wavered at times, my fervor for cricket remained unwavering, serving as a source of joy, camaraderie, and endless memories. These formative years taught me the importance of finding balance between responsibility and the pursuit of personal interests. They instilled in me a resilient spirit, encouraging me to forge my own path, even in the face of societal expectations. Through the bonds of friendship, the serenity of nature, and the thrill of competition, I discovered the power of dreams and the perseverance required to bring them to life.</p></div>
